# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

This repository contains machine learning models for predicting hotel booking cancellations.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Data Preparation

Before running any machine learning models, you **must** execute the data preparation notebook to generate the required processed datasets.

**Run the following file:**

- `Data_Prepatation.ipynb`

This notebook will:

- Load and clean the raw hotel booking data
- Perform feature engineering and preprocessing
- Handle missing values and encode categorical variables
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Apply data balancing techniques (if needed)
- Generate the following processed dataset files:
  - `X_train_processed.csv` - Processed training features
  - `X_test_processed.csv` - Processed testing features
  - `y_train.csv` - Training target variable (cancellation labels)
  - `y_test.csv` - Testing target variable (cancellation labels)

### Step 2: Model Training and Evaluation

After generating the processed datasets, you can run your machine learning models using these files:

- `KNN_Model.ipynb` - K-Nearest Neighbors model implementation
- Other model notebooks (add as needed)

Simply load the processed CSV files generated in Step 1 and apply your models.

## Generated Dataset Files Explained

The following files are generated by the data preparation notebook and are **not** included in the repository (see `.gitignore`):

### `X_train_processed.csv`

- **Purpose**: Contains the preprocessed feature variables for the training dataset
- **Content**: All input features (numerical and encoded categorical variables) that will be used to train the machine learning models
- **Format**: CSV file with rows representing individual hotel bookings and columns representing features

### `X_test_processed.csv`

- **Purpose**: Contains the preprocessed feature variables for the testing dataset
- **Content**: All input features for the test set, processed using the same transformations applied to the training data
- **Format**: CSV file with rows representing individual hotel bookings and columns representing features
- **Usage**: Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data

### `y_train.csv`

- **Purpose**: Contains the target variable (labels) for the training dataset
- **Content**: Binary classification labels indicating whether each booking was canceled (1) or not canceled (0)
- **Format**: CSV file with a single column of target values corresponding to each row in `X_train_processed.csv`
- **Usage**: Used to train supervised learning models

### `y_test.csv`

- **Purpose**: Contains the target variable (labels) for the testing dataset
- **Content**: Binary classification labels indicating whether each booking was canceled (1) or not canceled (0)
- **Format**: CSV file with a single column of target values corresponding to each row in `X_test_processed.csv`
- **Usage**: Used to evaluate model predictions and calculate performance metrics

## Important Notes

- The processed dataset files (`X_train_processed.csv`, `X_test_processed.csv`, `y_train.csv`, `y_test.csv`) are **not** stored in the repository due to their size and the fact that they can be regenerated
- Always run `Data_Prepatation.ipynb` first before executing any model notebooks

## Can ignore below ones, as you will already import libraries in Jupyter notebook cell
